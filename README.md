### Use

I would use this not only for our group project (though not pokemon), I would also use this in any project in Nuxt which needs to fetch data from an api, especially seeing it from a locally hosted data folder. I will probably do something similar on my final project as well.

After following along wiht the tutorial, i opted out of building the search bar function and went to work more on the group project. May return at a alter date to finish the tutorial (though I did watch it all).
